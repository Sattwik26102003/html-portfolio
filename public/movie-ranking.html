<h1>The best movies according to Sattwik</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>this is one of my favorite movies i have watched recently.Its plot, score and acting everything was perfect</p>
<h3>Uri: The surgical strike</h3>
<p>this is one of those movies that would make you feel pity if you watch it in you mobile phones. Its definately one of those action movies india has produced that can compete with hollywood movies</p>
<h3>Jolly LLb</h3>
<p>the most important aspect of this movie is that it is very close to reality and how the rich and powerful can take advantage of the corrupt system to deny justice to the poor</p>
